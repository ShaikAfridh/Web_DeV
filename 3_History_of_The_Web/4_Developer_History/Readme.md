# Full Stack Web DeVelopement 🚀🌐

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, the tools and technologies used by front-end and back-end developers have undergone significant transformations. Let's explore this journey through difference between them: one representing the 20s era and another showcasing modern technologies, all illustrated with emojis. 📸

## Full Stack Web Dev in the 20s 🕰️

In this nostalgic snapshot, we find the tech stack of the 20s era:

### Front-End Overview:
- **HTML and CSS**: The foundation of web design, structuring content and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and dynamic features.
- **jQuery**: Once a front-end favorite, simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.

### Back-End Overview (LAMP Stack):
- **Linux**: A robust operating system serving as the server environment.
- **Apache**: The web server handling HTTP requests.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system storing structured data.
- **PHP**: The server-side scripting language used for logic and dynamic content.

While this combination served well in its time, it's worth noting that jQuery, once widely adopted, has become somewhat outdated in modern web development, thanks to advancements in native JavaScript and other front-end libraries and frameworks. 📜⏳

## Modern of Full Stack DeV:

Fast forward to the present day, and we have an entirely new tech stack:

### Front-End (HTML5 and CSS3):
- **HTML5**: The latest iteration of HTML, offering improved structure and multimedia support.
- **CSS3**: Bringing a plethora of styling enhancements and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Still at the core for interactivity.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic, reusable UI components.

### Back-End (Node.js and Express.js):
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: A minimalistic and flexible Node.js web application framework.

### Databases:
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system for structured data.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible and unstructured data.

This modern stack reflects the current trends in web development. HTML5 and CSS3 provide enhanced design and multimedia capabilities, while JavaScript and React offer dynamic and interactive front-end experiences. On the back-end, Node.js and Express.js have gained popularity for their scalability and performance, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB cater to different data needs. 🌟🔌

In this ever-changing world of web development, staying up-to-date with the latest tools and technologies is essential to deliver cutting-edge, user-friendly web applications. The journey from the 20s to the present showcases how far we've come in shaping the digital landscape. 🚀🌐💡
