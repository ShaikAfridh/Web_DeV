### Front End Developer
A front-end developer focuses on creating the user interface and user experience of a website or application. They use:

- 🌐 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content.
- 🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout.
- 🚀 JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic features.
- ⚛️ React (a popular JavaScript library) for building dynamic and responsive web interfaces.

**Example**: google.com, known for its visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

### Back End Developer
A back-end developer works on the server-side of web applications. They handle requests from the front end, process data, and interact with databases. Technologies they use include:

- 🌐 Node.js for server-side JavaScript development.
- 🚀 Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, to simplify server-side code.
- 🗃️ PostgreSQL (or other databases) for storing and retrieving data.

The server communicates with the front end, much like a bridge between the user interface and the database.

In summary, a full-stack developer is skilled in both front-end and back-end development, creating a complete web application experience from the visual design to the server-side functionality. The front-end developer focuses on what users see and interact with, while the back-end developer works behind the scenes to manage data and server operations. Together, they create a seamless and functional web application.
