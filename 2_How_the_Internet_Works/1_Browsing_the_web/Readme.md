# Browsing the Web 🌐

How we just casullay search things in web browser and get the desired output in our browsers like Google Chrome, MS Edge.. etc. In below scenario we can see how Internet works! in backend.



## 🖥️ Step 1: Opening Chrome

It all begins when you open your web browser, let's say Google Chrome. You're ready to explore the vast online world.

## 🌍 Step 2: Typing google.com

You decide to visit the Google website, so you type "google.com" into your browser's address bar. But how does your computer know where to find Google's website?

## 📡 Step 3: Going to the ISP

When you hit Enter after typing "google.com," your request doesn't go directly to Google. Instead, it first travels to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Think of your ISP as the gateway to the internet. It's like the post office for your internet traffic.

## 💼 Step 4: The DNS (Domain Name System)

Your ISP plays a crucial role in translating the human-friendly "google.com" into a machine-readable address, an IP (Internet Protocol) address. This process is performed by the Domain Name System (DNS).

## 💡 Step 5: DNS Magic

The DNS is like the phone book of the internet. When your request reaches the DNS server, it searches for the IP address associated with "google.com." Once it finds the right IP address which is 142.250.182.46, it sends it back to your computer.

## 🚀 Step 6: Back to the ISP

Now that your computer knows where to find Google's website (thanks to the IP address provided by the DNS), it sends a request back to your ISP, saying, "I want to visit this IP address."

## 💻 Step 7: Displaying google.com

Your ISP acts as a bridge between your computer and Google's servers. It forwards your request to Google's data center. Google's servers then send back the data that makes up the Google homepage to your ISP, which finally delivers it to your computer.

## 🌟 You see the Google website on your screen  

This entire process happens in a matter of milliseconds, making it seem almost magical. But in reality, it's a complex system of interconnected computers, servers, and protocols working seamlessly to bring you the internet experience you know and love.

So, the next time you open your web browser and type in a website address, remember the journey your request takes from your laptop to your ISP, through the DNS, and finally to the web server. It's a fascinating dance of technology that keeps us connected to the world wide web. 🌐🔗🌐
